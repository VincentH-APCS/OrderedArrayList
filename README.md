# OrderedArrayList
 Use the compare to methods from comparable to sort in the method
Since our object is comparable, we can use that to compare each thing
to another, like for integers -like numerical order.
Question: Does NoNullArrayList need any private variables.
Added clarification of what "the point" of NoNullArrayList is
/please commit??

going over what we put for add() and some further clarification

talking about the constructors and need for private variables
--no need for instance variables because inherited from parent
classes --unsure about the constructors
-should be the same as the constructor for a regular ArrayList
